                        <p>As a consumer, you have the right to have your new car serviced by whomever you choose, without that choice affecting the seller's statutory warranty obligations. Lube Mobile works precisely to manufacturer's specifications for new car servicing.</p>
                        <p>You get an independent warranty on parts and labour associated with your Lube Mobile service and repairs. We cover our work for 12 months or 20,000km, nationwide, and your statutory warranty remains unaffected.Here is what the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission had to say about car servicing and statutory warranties on new vehicles:</p>
                        <p>"A common concern for new car buyers is their right to have someone, other than the dealer, service the car without putting warranties at risk. Judging by the large number of calls received by the ACCC many buyers are uncertain.</p>

                        <p> Where a problem arises (other than in servicing) and it is covered by the warranty, the vehicle should be taken to the dealer for repair.</p>
                        <p>Under the Trade Practices Act dealers cannot limit their warranty obligations or claim the warranty is void if the vehicle is serviced by someone other than the dealer or its agent. The statutory warranty applies to new and second hand cars. A consumer expects a second hand car to run effectively without repairs although, depending on price and age, it may not be expected to last as long as, or perform to the same </p>
